Internet-Draft               ActivityStreams                  April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Activity Streams specification defines a format for describing
   socially interesting events, or "Activities", about the people and
   things an individual may care about.  This specification describes
   the mechanisms by which responses or reactions to those events or
   their related objects may also be described.

   The possible range of reactions to an event or object vary broadly
   and include such actions as posting a comment, sharing the event with
   others, "liking" or "favoriting" the event or object, RSVP'ing to an
   event invite and so on.  This specification does not attempt to cover
   the full range of possible reactions.  Rather, it seeks to establish
   a common pattern for the expression of those reactions within an
   Activity Stream and defines a set of extension properties
   exemplifying that pattern.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
   conformance.  Examples in this specification are non-normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The "inReplyTo" Property

   The "inReplyTo" property MAY be used within any Activity Stream
   object to identify other objects for which the containing object is
   considered a response.  The value of the "inReplyTo" property is a
   JSON [RFC4627] Array of Activity Stream Objects.  For example:

     {
       "objectType": "comment",
       "content": "<p>This is a comment</p>",
       "inReplyTo": [
         {
           "objectType": "note",
           "id": "http://example.org/objects/123",
           "displayName": "A simple note"
         }
       ]
     }

   In many cases, such as when an object appears as a member of a

   collection of objects in a property that clearly indicates a response
   or reaction relationship with a parent object, the "inReplyTo"
   property can be implied.  For instance, the "replies" property
   defined below in Section 4 may contain a listing of child objects
   with an implied "inReplyTo" property referring to the parent object.


4.  Responses and Activity Summaries

   It is common practice to provide summary information on the number
   and types of activities that have occurred with respect to a given
   object.  For instance, a "note" object may have been the target of
   any number of comment, like, or share activities.  This summary
   information MAY be expressed in the JSON serialization of an object
   by using a property name descriptive of the data being summarized and
   using the Collection object as defined by the JSON Activity Streams
   document.

   The following properties MAY be used on any object type or activity
   for each of the specified situations:

   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Property          | Description                                   |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | "attending"       | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of actors that have responded to   |
   |                   | an "event" using the "rsvp-yes" verb.         |
   | "followers"       | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of objects (typically person       |
   |                   | objects) that are "following" the containing  |
   |                   | object.                                       |
   | "following"       | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of objects that this object is     |
   |                   | "following".                                  |
   | "friends"         | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of objects with which a            |
   |                   | "friendship" relationship has been            |
   |                   | established using the "make-friend" verb.     |
   |                   | This property will typically only be relevant |
   |                   | for the "person" object type.                 |
   | "friend-requests" | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of objects with which a            |
   |                   | "friendship" relationship is being requested  |
   |                   | using the "request-friend" verb.  This        |
   |                   | property will typically only be relevant for  |
   |                   | the "person" object type.                     |

   | "likes"           | Used to provide information about the actors  |
   |                   | (typically person objects) that have          |
   |                   | favorited or liked the containing object.     |
   | "notAttending"    | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of actors that have responded to   |
   |                   | an "event" using the "rsvp-no" verb.          |
   | "maybeAttending"  | Used to provide information about the         |
   |                   | collection of actors that have responded to   |
   |                   | an "event" using the "rsvp-maybe" verb.       |
   | "members"         | Used to provide information about the actors  |
   |                   | (typically person objects) that have "joined" |
   |                   | the containing object.  This is typically     |
   |                   | only useful for object types that represent   |
   |                   | groups.                                       |
   | "replies"         | Used to provide information about the thread  |
   |                   | of discussion associated with a given object. |
   |                   | Typically, the objects contained will have an |
   |                   | implied "inReplyTo" property value equal to   |
   |                   | the object containing the "replies" property. |
   | "reviews"         | Used to provide information about reviews     |
   |                   | available for the containing object.          |
   | "saves"           | Used to provide information about the actors  |
   |                   | (typically person objects) that have "saved"  |
   |                   | the containing object.                        |
   | "shares"          | Used to provide information about the actors  |
   |                   | (typically person objects) that have "shared" |
   |                   | the containing object.                        |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   The following example illustrates the use of these properties.  Note
   that the value of the "totalItems" property indicates the total
   number of items in the associated collections and may not match the
   actual number of objects in the "items" property.  For instance, in
   the example below, for the "likes" property, the "totalItems"
   property specifies the value 120 but includes only a single object.
   This SHOULD be interpreted along the lines of "John and 119 other
   users like this note".

5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms defined herein are subject to the same security
   considerations as all activities.  Applications must be aware of the
   risk posed by a malicious third party attempting to artificially
   inject inappropriate content into the stream of responses and replies
   of an object.  For instance, services that aggregate activity streams

   from multiple sources and attempt to reconstruct a thread of
   discussion using replies and response from across those sources could
   be tricked into displaying illegitimate content if appropriate
   consideration is not given to the content origin.  Mitigation of such
   threats is considered out of scope for this specification.
