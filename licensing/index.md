## Licensing ##

The specifications produced by the Activity Streams community are made
available under the terms of the [OpenWeb Foundation 1.0 Agreement][OWFa].  The
signed agreements are available in the source repository for each specification.

 - [JSON Activity Streams 1.0](https://github.com/activitystreams/json-activity/tree/master/agreements)


### Signing the CLA and OWFa ###

Any individual or company that intends to contribute to any of the Activity
Streams specifications is encouraged to sign and submit an
[OWF Contributor License Agreement][cla].  This indicates the signer's
voluntary support for the development and publication of the specification.

Once a final specification is ready to be published, contributors and supporters
of the specification will be asked to sign an [OWFa][] to formalize their copyright
licenses and patent promises to the entire specification.

To submit a CLA or OWFa for an Activity Streams specification, download the
appropriate form, sign, and scan as a PDF.  Then send a [pull request][] for the
appropriate [git repository][], or alternatively send it to the Activity Streams
[mailing list][].
